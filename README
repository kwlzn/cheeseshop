This repo hosts python library distributions not yet a available on pypi.

In fact it may host distributions equivalent to those on pypi but in
general only hosts distributions built from the authoritative repo
mainline at a given sha.

This allows pantsbuild projects to evolve quickly against third party
mainlines when needed.
